<h1>Chess JS </h1>

As a challenge to test our understandment of JS, DOM manipulation and CSS during the _Nology course we were asked to build a game. This were the specificications for the project:
<ul>
    <li>A fully functioning game;</li>
    <li>build with JS, HTML and CSS/SASS;</li>
    <li>deployed on GitHup pages;</li>
    <li>made at least 15 meaningful commits;</li>
    <li>code formatted correctly;</li>
    <li>build with a mobile first approach;</li>
</ul>

    <li>Technologies</li>
    <li>Setup</li>
    <li>Status</li>
    <li>Future development</li>
</ul>

<h2>General Info</h2>
<p>It is a fully working chess game. When a piece is clicked the possible moves are displayed on the board. If a different piece is clicked the moves are updated or cleared if it was clicked an empty tile. If the king get checked its tile will get red borders. If a player checkmate the others this will be displayed at the bottom of the board. </p>
<p>Castling in all directions and en-passant are supported.</p> 
<p>At the bottom of the page there is a button to restart the game.</p>
<p>Currently the game is for 2 players only.</p>

<h2>Technologies</h2>
<p>The game was built with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS / SASS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Just access the game on GitHub pages <a href="https://martinelli-89.github.io/ChessJS/">(Chess JS)</a> and have fun!</p>

<h2>Status<h2>
<p>The game is fully working. However the media queryes for different screen sizes, due to the lack of time, are minimal and needs to be improve for a better user experience on devices larger than a small phone.</p> 

<h2>Future developement</h2>
I would like to work on the following features when I will have the knowledge or the time:
<ul>
    <li>Improve media queries;</li>
    <li>Add scores and clearly displayed whos turn it is;</li>
    <li>Add a basic AI for single player</li>
    <li>Add a feature to change the color of the board</li>
</ul>
